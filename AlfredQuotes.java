    Final Challenge!
    Alfred is listening. Write a method that accepts any string of conversation. 
    If "Alexis" appears in the conversation return a snarky response, such as:
    "Right away, sir. She certainly isn't sophisticated enough for that." 
    If "Alfred" is in the conversation return an obliging response, for example: 
    "At your service. As you wish, naturally." 
    If neither name is found, return an appropriate response, for instance:
    "Right. And with that I shall retire."
